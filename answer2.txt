ques) 	What is the difference between rebase and git merge?

ans)
 Git merge : Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent 	      lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
	     Git merge is used to combine two branches.it merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find a common 		     base commit between them. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes 		     of each queued merge commit sequence.
	
Git rebase: Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and 		    easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
	    The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. For example, consider a situation where the main      
	    branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch. You want to get the latest updates to the main branch in 
	    your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history clean so it appears as if you've been working off the 
	    latest main branch. This gives later benefit of a clean merge of your feature branch back into the main branch
